# JMCalculator
Hey! This is my first Git project. This program is only needed to read 2 numbers from a string and an operation between them.
Then calculate the result and print it to the console. But the input can be normal and Roman numerals.
The conclusion is consistent. On entering a number from 1 to 10 inclusive.
Thanks for attention.
